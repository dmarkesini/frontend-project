## Installation

To run the project locally you need to clone the repository and then run the following commands on the terminal.

<b>NOTE: The minimum version of Node.js to run the project is v6.9 and v8.7 for Postgres. </b>

1. First, please fork the project from this link https://github.com/dmarkesini/Backend-project.git

2. To clone the project on your device enter this command into the terminal along with the link of your forked project

```sh
git clone <project_name_here>
```

3. Then, go into the directory and open the project

```sh
cd Backend-project
```

4. Install the dependencies with this command

```sh
npm install
```

5. To be able to run this project locally, you will need to create the following two <b>.env</b> files in the main directory:

```sh
1. .env.test
2. .env.development
```

Inside the files you need to add this: <b>PGDATABASE=<database_name_here></b> which will need to include the right database name for that environment. Please check the <b> /db/setup.sql</b> file for the accurate database names.

Lastly, you need to make sure these files are inside the .gitignored file. You can do this with writing <b>.env.\*</b> inside .gitignore.

6. Once you have all dependencies installed, you can go ahead and seed the local database

```sh
npm run setup-dbs
```

7. Once the database is seeded, you are good to go! You can run the tests with Jest by typing the following

```sh
npm test app.test.js
```
